# Python Project Template

# 1. Prepare Problem
# a) Load libraries (the modules, classes and funcitons used)
# b) Load dataset

# 2. Summarize Data
# a) Descriptive statistics
# b) Data visualizations
# Spend time here, prompt questions, assumptions and hypothesis

# 3. Prepare Data
# a) Data Cleaning (remove duplicates, mark or input the missing values)
# b) Feature Selection (remove redundant features)
# c) Data Transforms (rescale and redistribute)

# 4. Evaluate Algorithms
# a) Split-out validation dataset
# b) Test options and evaluation metric
# c) Spot Check Algorithms
# d) Compare Algorithms
# this step takes time, need at least 3-5 well performing machine learning algorithms

# 5. Improve Accuracy (choose one between a or b)
# a) Algorithm Tuning (search for a combination of parameters for each algortihm that yields the best results)
# b) Ensembles (combine the prediction of multiple models)

# 6. Finalize Model
# a) Predictions on validation dataset
# b) Create standalone model on entire training dataset
# c) Save model for later use
